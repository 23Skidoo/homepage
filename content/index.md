title: About
---

I am a software engineer (currently working at [Scrive](https://scrive.com)) with a
long-standing interest in statically typed functional programming
(primarily [Haskell](http://haskell.org)), type systems, compiler construction,
programming languages research and related topics. This is my personal
blog.
