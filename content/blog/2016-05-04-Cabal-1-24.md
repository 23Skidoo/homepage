We've just released versions 1.24 of both Cabal and `cabal-install`. The 1.24
release incorporates more than a thousand commits by
[89 different contributors](https://gist.github.com/23Skidoo/62544d7e0352037749eec7344788831c). This
post describes what's new and improved in this version.

User-visible features
---------------------

* Nix-style local builds in `cabal-install` (so far only a technical
  preview). See
  [this post](http://blog.ezyang.com/2016/05/announcing-cabal-new-build-nix-style-local-builds/)
  by Edward Z. Yang for more details.

* Integration of a new security scheme for Hackage based on
  [The Update Framework](https://theupdateframework.github.io/). So far this is
  not enabled by default, pending some changes on the Hackage side. See
  [these](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/08/hackage-security-beta/)
  [three](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/hackage-security-alpha/)
  [posts](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/04/improving-hackage-security/) by
  Edsko de Vries and Duncan Coutts for more information.

* Support for specifying setup script dependencies in `.cabal` files. Setup
  scripts are also now built with the `cabal_macros.h`-style macros for
  conditional compilation. See
  [this post by Duncan Coutts](http://www.well-typed.com/blog/2015/07/cabal-setup-deps/)
  for more information.

* Support for HTTPS downloads in `cabal-install`. HTTPS is now used by default
  for downloads from Hackage. This uses either `curl` or `wget` or, on Windows,
  PowerShell, under the hood. Install target URLs can now also use HTTPS,
  e.g. `cabal install https://example.com/foo-1.0.tar.gz`.

* `cabal upload` learned how to upload documentation to Hackage
  (`cabal upload --doc`) ([#2890](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2890)).

* In related news, `cabal haddock` now can generate documentation intended for
  uploading to Hackage (`cabal haddock --for-hackage`,
  [#2852](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2852)). `cabal upload --doc`
  runs this command automatically if the documentation for current package
  hasn't been generated yet.

* New `cabal-install` command: `gen-bounds` for easy generation of version
  bounds. See
  [this post by Doug Beardsley](http://softwaresimply.blogspot.se/2015/08/cabal-gen-bounds-easy-generation-of.html)
  for more information.

* It's now possible to limit the scope of `--allow-newer` to single
  packages in the install plan, both on the command line and in the config
  file. See [here](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2756) for an
  example.

* The `--allow-newer` option can be now used with `./Setup configure`
  ([#3163](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/3163)).

* New `cabal user-config` subcommand: `init`, which creates a default config
  file in either the default location (`~/.cabal/config`) or as specified by
  `--config-file` ([#2553](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2553)).

* New config file field `extra-framework-dirs` for specifying extra locations to
  find OS X frameworks in ([#3158](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3158)).
  Can be also specified as an argument for `install` and `configure` commands.

* `cabal-install` solver now takes information about extensions and language
  flavours into account
  ([#2873](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2873)). The solver is now also
  aware of `pkg-config` constraints
  ([#3023](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3023)).

* New `cabal-install` option:
  [`--offline`](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2578), which
  prevents `cabal-install` from downloading anything from the Internet.

* New `cabal upload` option
  [`-P`/`--password-command`](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2506)
  for reading Hackage password from arbitrary program output.

* New `--profiling-detail=$level` flag with a default for libraries and
  executables of 'exported-functions' and 'toplevel-functions' respectively
  (GHC's `-fprof-auto-{exported,top}` flags)
  ([#193](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/193)).

* New `--show-detail` mode: `--show-detail=direct`; like `streaming`, but allows
  the test program to detect that is connected to a terminal, and works reliable
  with a non-threaded runtime
  ([#2911](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2911), and serves as a
  work-around for [#2398](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2398))

* Macros `VERSION_$pkgname` and `MIN_VERSION_$pkgname` are now also generated
  for the current package ([#3235](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3235)).

* The `builddir` option can now be specified via the `CABAL_BUILDDIR`
  environment variable and in `cabal.config`
  ([#2484](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/2484)).

* Added a log file message similar to one printed by `make` when building in
  another directory ([#2642](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2642)).


Bug fixes and minor improvements
--------------------------------

* Support for GHC 8. NB: pre-1.24 versions of Cabal won't work with GHC 8.

* Cabal is now aware of extra C sources generated by preprocessors (e.g. `c2hs`
  and `hsc2hs`) ([#2467](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2467)).

* Cabal now includes `cabal_macros.h` when running `c2hs`
  ([#2600](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2600)).

* C sources are now recompiled only when needed
  ([#2601](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2601)).

* Support Haddock response files to work around command-line length restrictions
  on Windows ([#2746](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2746)).

* Library support for multi-instance package DBs
  ([#2948](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2948)).

* Improvements in the `./Setup configure` solver
  ([#3082](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3082),
  [#3076](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3076)).

* If there are multiple remote repos, `cabal update` now updates them in
  parallel ([#2503](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2503)).

* `cabal` program itself now can be used as an external setup method. This fixes
  an issue when Cabal version mismatch caused unnecessary reconfigures
  ([#2633](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2633)).

* Fixed space leaks in `cabal update`
  ([#2826](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2826)) and in the solver
  ([#2916](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2916),
  [#2914](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2914)). Improved performance of
  `--reorder-goals` ([#3208](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/3208)).

* `cabal exec` and `sandbox hc-pkg` now use the configured compiler
  ([#2859](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2859)).

* The man page for `cabal-install` is now automatically generated
  ([#2877](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2877)).

* Miscellaneous minor and/or internal bug fixes and improvements.

Acknowledgements
----------------

Thanks to everyone who contributed code and bug reports, and to Ryan Thomas for
helping with release management. Full list of people who contributed patches to
Cabal/`cabal-install` 1.24 is available
[here](https://gist.github.com/23Skidoo/62544d7e0352037749eec7344788831c).

Looking forward
---------------

We plan to make a new release of Cabal/`cabal-install` approximately 6 months
after 1.24 &mdash; that is, in late October or early November 2016. Main
features that are currently targeted at 1.26 are:

* Further work on nix-style local builds, perhaps making that code path the
default.

* Enabling Hackage Security by default.

* Native suport for
  [foreign libraries](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/2540): Haskell
  libraries that are intended to be used by non-Haskell code.

* New Parsec-based parser for `.cabal` files.

* A revamped homepage for Cabal, rewritten user manual, and automated build bots
  for binary releases.

We would like to encourage people considering contributing to take a look at
[the bug tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/), take part
in discussions on tickets and pull requests, or submit their own. The bug
tracker is reasonably well maintained and it should be relatively clear to new
contributors what is in need of attention and which tasks are considered
relatively easy. For more in-depth discussion there is also the
[`cabal-devel` mailing list](https://mail.haskell.org/mailman/listinfo/cabal-devel).
