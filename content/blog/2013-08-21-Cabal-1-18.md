The 1.18 release of Cabal is almost ready. This post describes what's new and
improved in this version.

User-visible features
---------------------

* Sandboxes - isolated environments for building packages, similar to (and
inspired by) what the popular `cabal-dev` tool provides. See
[this article](/blog/2013-08-20-Cabal-sandbox.html) for a more detailed
introduction.

* `cabal repl` - New command that opens an interpreter session for the given
target (executable or library). Code based on patches developed during GSoC 2011
by Sam Anklesaria.

* `cabal get` - New command that replaces `cabal unpack`. When given the
`--source-repository` argument (short form: `-s`) `cabal get` checks out a
working copy of a given package's source code using the appropriate revision
control system.

* `cabal run` - New command that compiles and runs the given executable. Instead
of `cabal build && ./dist/build/prog/prog --args`, you can now use `cabal run
prog -- --args`.

* Better support for cross-compilation: target platform is now inferred by
parsing compiler's output (i.e., `ghc --info`). Packages are now installed to
`$arch-$os-$compiler/$pkgid` instead of `$pkgid/$compiler` by
default. ([#1214](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1214))

* It's now possible to specify a target for the `build` and `repl` commands. For
example, if your package includes executables `foo` and `bar`, you can run
`cabal build foo` to build only `foo` (and its dependencies). If there's also a
library or test-suite named `foo`, `cabal build exe:foo` can be used for
disambiguation.

* New `cabal configure` and config file option: `extra-prog-path`. Allows to
specify a list of directories to be searched for required programs. In
newly-created config files it is initialised to `~/.cabal/bin`, which should
solve the common problem when `cabal` couldn't find programs that the user have
just installed (usually `alex`/`happy`/`c2hs`) because they were in a location
not on `$PATH` ([#1415](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/pull/1415)).

* Two new config file sections: `program-locations` and
`program-default-options`. This allows to specify custom paths and options for
the required programs ([#1328](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1328)).

* `extra-doc-files`: new package property for installing extra files referenced
  from the Haddock documentation, e.g. images (the
  [`lens` package](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/lens) is a good
  example). ([#1182](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1182)).

* Support for executables with C/C++/Obj-C main functions
([#1080](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1080)).

* `c-sources` can now depend on headers generated for Haskell FFI exports
(`*_stub.h`) ([#1080](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1080)).

* Support for test and benchmark documentation with Haddock
([#1374](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1374)).

* Support for GNU AGPLv3 license
([#1361](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1361)).

* The `jobs` field in the config file is now initialised with `$ncpus`.

* `install --dependencies-only` is now a synonym for `install
  --only-dependencies`.

Bug fixes and minor improvements
--------------------------------

* GHC 7.8 support ([#1252](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1252),
[#1384](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1384)).

* `cabal update` now downloads package metadata only if the server has a newer
version ([#799](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/799),
[#1341](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1341)).

* `cabal init` now generates less restrictive version bounds
([#1329](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1329)).

* `cabal init` now can guess common types of extra-source-files
([#1157](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1157)).

* Absoulute paths are now passed to Haddock as proper URLs
([#1064](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1064),
[#1406](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1406)).

* `dist/build/autogen` dir is now included in the `-I` search list for c-sources
([#1351](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1351)).

* When building libraries, `c-sources` are now built separately for profiling
([#1286](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1286)).

* The `--package-db` flag now correctly handles relative paths
([234417c2](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/commit/234417c2a603d4d23222048e09cb2caa254ac755)).

* Annoying missing haddock warning for the rts package is now suppressed
([#1231](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1231)).

* Improved warning for old versions of HPC
([#1155](https://github.com/haskell/cabal/issues/1155)).

* Miscellaneous minor and/or internal bug fixes and improvements.
